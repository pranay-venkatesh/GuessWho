# GuessWho
A basic guesswho game made in Java

The names for various arbitrary characters are taken from the notepad file Names.txt. This is simply a list of user-defined names. These names are provided with arbitrary attributes such as eye colour, hair colour etc. Based on guessing from given set of factors, the characters are eliminated till one is guessed. Special thanks to Sankeerth who helped me out.
